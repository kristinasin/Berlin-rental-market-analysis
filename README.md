# Analysis-of-the-Berlin-rental-market
At first I took a web-site with rental advertisements in Berlin (https://www.immobilienscout24.de/Suche/S-T/Wohnung-Miete/Berlin/Berlin), parsed it and got all the current advertisements. Then I analyzed the data, made some plots. Then the Ridge linear model is built to forecast the monthly rent of an apartment by other indicators. Then I save all the new advertisements to SQL database where I have advertisements from previous days.
